This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:
![switch color](https://github.com/sunnyvicap/ColorSwitchTheme/assets/28058594/0c772e15-d7b3-45cd-8257-360ba3696b1b)

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

In this app you can switch between multiple color and see how you can apply and handle theme of your app from on file.
